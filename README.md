# Minimum Lovable Product (architecture documents)


### What do we want ?

 - set the tools to help large group to produce a single text or a reduced set (output)
   set of text is to be submitted to referendum
   that consider **all**  nodes' (individual) versions (inputs)
 - final version is obtained by applying a merge algorithm in a distributed manner.
 - requirements:
     each documents need to be equally reviewed
     every willing members need to participate _equally_ (sovereignty is not sharable)
     participation must be "de-indentified" (tokenisation)

 - one time delegation (voting token: avoid power, all token must be used)
 - several rounds for reduction of proposed texts

 - democracy processus of generalization of a politic proposition
   to reveal the generality (hard/soft consensus)

 - when deciding on future hypothesis are made, ... (if else)
 



### RELEASE 0.0:

1. module saisie version (optionally collaborative)
   proposed texts are locally stored in each nodes and must be registered to be considered
   (need redundancy among registration servers)

2. module fair distribution of token

3. module distribution of version (gossip ?)

   common knowledge of where to find texts (urn...) (common knowledge to be pushed)
   ex. /public/round-1/1-50/text45 (locally centralized: P2P pull)
   
4. module ranking & reduction texts

5. interation until reduced set is equally contradictory (option).

6. module vote to decide on final options
